# Swift-GoogleMaps-Example
Swift client server iOS application example with use of Google Maps SDK. Written entirely on Swift and extremely extensible.

## Requirements

**Xcode version 7.3.1 (7D1014)** with **iOS 9.2 SDK** required.
**CocoaPods 1.0** is also a must.

## Installation

Open the Source folder and run ```$ pod intsall``` in the dedicated project folder.

You could also use the built-in **PodInstall.command** file if you're super lazy.

Wait for the CocoaPods to finish installation.

Run the dedicated server on this address - ```http://localhost:8080/``` using sources provided in the Backend folder.

Open the SaitamaRent.xcworkspace file in Xcode. Choose the target and hit Build and Run.

Congratulations!

## Compatibility

Tested on iPhone and iPad with iOS 8.0 and up, 9.0 and up and iOS 10.0 Developer Beta 1. Project minimal deployment target is iOS 8.0.

This project uses ARC and is Bitcode compatiable. Project is built on top of Storyboards and Xibs with Autolayout and Size Classes. Project is fully Swift but contains Objective-C bridging header for safely and securely using legacy Objective-C pods and classes.
